Two of my favorite quotes:

- Reading – an extraordinary ability, peculiarly human and yet distinctly unnatural, acquired in childhood, forms an intrinsic part of our existence as human beings, and is taken for granted by most of us.  Sally Shaywitz, 2003
- Reading is a process of **reconstructing sense** from **text written in a language** that we **already know and understan_d_**. (Real Spelling)
