The words <**plays, played, player, playing, playful**\> are composed of bases and suffixes: <-**s, -ed, -er, -ing, -ful**\> are suffixes. <**Playmate, playlist, playground, play-date**\> are compound words  composed of two bases.

Worried about students not having strong or rich vocabulary?Understanding and using morphology – bases and affixes – can provide the answer you need to teach the connections that exist among words and reinforce vocabulary learning.

From the simple everyday word ‘**_play_**’ see how many words you can generate:  <**play, plays, played, playing, player, players, playful, playfully, replay, replays, replayed, playlist, playground, playmate, play-date**\>.

You can discuss parts of speech: verbs, nouns, adjective, adverbs, etc; Verb tenses: present, past, and continuous; nouns: singular and plural; and compound words.

Usage: the words **_play_** and **_plays_** can be both verbs or nouns depending on context: how they are used in sentences. These are some of the rich discussions that can take place in either a small or large group setting: at home or at school. **_Playful_** is an adjective, but the suffix <**\-ly**\> turns it into an adverb <**playfully**\>. You could play some games by using the words in sentences and observing how the words' parts of speech change when their positions in the sentences (word order) change. Use '**_play_**' as a verb in a sentence and then use it as a noun. In this way, your students (or children) can learn a very valuable lesson about 'parts of speech'. In English a word's part of speech is entirely dependent on how the word is used in a sentence.

Notice how movable the adverb is: you can move the adverb around in sentences without dramatically changing the meaning of the sentences: the position of the adverb just changes the words that are emphasized.

She **_playfully_** kicked the ball around the room.

She kicked the ball **_playfully_** around the room.

She kicked the ball around the room **_playfully_**.

**_Playfully_** she kicked the ball around the room.

You will be amazed at the lessons you can learn when you simply play around with words. Just try it!
